intellij

What I dislike
will ignore maven compiler options for java version and ask for sdk
build happens when you want to run, slow, even shows message that it finished, no difference what compiler you use.
line comment has no key assigned
optimize impots crashes
how do I get back to last editor position?

What I love
Spellchecking of method and variable names is owsom, this should be standard for all Ricoh developers





shift + F6		rename
ctrl + alt		format
ctrl + Alt + O	optimize imports
